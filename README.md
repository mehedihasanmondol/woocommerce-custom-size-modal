# Wordpress Woocommerce addOns
## Client requirement
We are developing a woocommerce and need a little help here.  
We need to disable the default modal of woocommerce where it says : Please select some product options before adding this product to your cart.

Picture added in attachement.

We already put a custom code in plugin, we can see our custom code modal is showing but the default modal is not stopping.
